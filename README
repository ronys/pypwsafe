A pure-Python library that can read and write Password Safe v3 files has been released under the GPLv2 by Symantec. 



There are a few known issues: 

1) HMAC validation fails with some recent versions of Password Safe. I suspect this is an issue with the support for bug 1812081. 
2) Some of the more recent record properties aren't supported
3) Lack of documentation
4) Unit tests are out-of-date
5) Need to add an install script

Deps: 
1) python-mcrypt
2) hashlib

Install Instructions
1) Install libmcrypt and it's dev package: 
	yum install libmcrypt-devel libmcrypt
	These packages are needed by 
2) Use Pip or easy install to install python-mcrypt
3) Run the setup script
	python setup.py install
4) Test that the module loads
	python -c "import pypwsafe"
