A pure-Python library that can read and write Password Safe v3 files. The library was initially released by Symantec under the GPLv2 in 2011. 



There are a few known issues: 

1) Lack of documentation
2) Unit tests are out-of-date
3) There MAY be an issue with the order that NonDefaultPrefsHeader serializes prefs for HMAC validation.
4) The version of python-mcrypt for Windows isn't compatible with this library. As a result, this library doesn't work in Windows. If anyone is able to get around this, please notify us. The library has not been tried under Cygwin.
