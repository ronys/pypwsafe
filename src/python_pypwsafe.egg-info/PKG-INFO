Introduction
============
A pure-Python library that can read and write Password Safe v3 
files. It includes full support for almost all current Password
Safe v3 database headers and record headers. 

History
=======
The library was initially written by Paulson McIntyre for
Symantec in 2009. It was later released by Symantec under the 
GPLv2 in 2011. Changes and updates have been made since by Paulson
McIntyre (GpMidi), Evan Deaubl (evandeaubl), and Sean Perry (shaleh).
Rony Shapiro maintains the project page and acts as gate keeper
for new patches.   

Known Issues
============ 
 1. Lack of documentation
 2. Unit tests are out-of-date
 3. There MAY be an issue with the order that NonDefaultPrefsHeader serializes preferences for HMAC validation in pypwsafe. Although the library validates HMACs fine at the moment, so who knows. 
 4. The version of python-mcrypt for Windows isn't compatible with this library. As a result, the pypwsafe library doesn't work in Windows. If anyone is able to get around this, please notify us. The library has not been tried under Cygwin.    
	 
Dependencies
============
PyCryptodome

Install Instructions
====================

RHEL/CentOS (NEEDS UPDATING)
-----------
 1. Install libmcrypt and it's dev package along with the Python dev package: 
	yum install libmcrypt-devel libmcrypt python-devel
	These packages are needed by the installer for python2-mcrypt
 2. Install the standard Linux development tools. For RHEL/CentOS 5 and 6, `yum groupinstall 'Development tools'` can be used if your YUM repos have group information. 
 3. Use Pip or easy install to install python2-mcrypt, hashlib, and pycrypto
 4. Run the setup script
	python setup.py install
 5. Test that the module loads
	python -c "import pypwsafe"

MACOSX (NEEDS UPDATING)
---------
1. Install clang compiler using brew:
   brew install llvm
2. Install mcrypt using brew:
   brew install mcrypt
   This package is needed by the installer for python2-mcrypt
3. Use Pip or easy install to install python2-mcrypt, hashlib, and pycrypto
4. Run the setup script
   python setup.py install
5. Test that the module loads
   python -c "import pypwsafe"

Windows (NEEDS UPDATING)
-------
Windows is not currently supported due to issues with python-mcrypt. A
pure-Python Twofish implementation will allow future support, if a bit
slower than a C-based implementation.

FAQ
===

### Where can I find details on the Password Safe file format?
The format spec is kept in the Password Safe project's git repo. Go 
to the password safe code base and check in docs/formatV3.txt.
As of today, it can be found [here](https://github.com/pwsafe/pwsafe/blob/master/docs/formatV3.txt) 
	
TODO
====
1. Need to update against the latest version of the official pwsafe format v3 doc.
